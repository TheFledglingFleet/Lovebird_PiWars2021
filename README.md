# Lovebird_PiWars2021
 Robot code and structure for the Pi Wars 2021 robot, Lovebird

In the same directory that Lovebird_PiWars2021 is placed, I have a runLovebird.py placed there. That way, I only have to run "python3 runLovebird.py" on my raspberry pi, and it pulls the lastest version of Lovebird's code, and runs main.py.
